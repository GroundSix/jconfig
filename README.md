jconfig
=======

This is a Go package to parse a configuration file using JSON.

It's really simple and does nothing fancy.  We wouldn't have bothered releasing it
except that a few other projects we will be releasing depend on it.

Installation
------------

Use `goinstall`:

    goinstall github.com/stathat/jconfig

If you are building your code with `goinstall`, you can skip the previous step and just
import `jconfig` as follows:

    import (
            "github.com/stathat/jconfig"
    )
